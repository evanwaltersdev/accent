title: Django?
---
I recently embarked on an attempt to learn a new framework/language. I started with Go, a new, young language, but I decided it wasn’t good for my use case. I was looking around for some fullstack frameworks, and I came across Django. I don’t know why I have never tried to use this yet, since I know Python fairly well. I found some good tutorials on YouTube and I’ll follow them this evening. I’ll keep you posted.
