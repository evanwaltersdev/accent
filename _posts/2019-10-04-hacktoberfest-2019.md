Another year, another wave of 100 PR's to sort through. 

Last year me and Unixfy setup a project to help people get started with GitHub and get started with the basic principles of Git and pull requests.

It involved a user adding a coding tutorial to a "videos.html" document. The problem was, I would go to sleep and there will be 30 conflicting PR's I have to sort through. 

After some discussion, we decided we would incorperate the project into the Hexo SSG. A user can add a post with their name, GitHub and some other stuff. Finally I will be able to have peace and not fix conflicts constatly. Hopefully this will be completed by the end of today, before interest dies down for Hacktoberfest.



That's enough for today, I'll keep you posted when the new system launches.



Happy Hacking!
